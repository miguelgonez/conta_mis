# Slowbooks Pro 2026

**A personal bookkeeping application raised from the ashes of QuickBooks 2003 Pro.**

Free, source-available, and complete: double-entry accounting, unlimited
invoicing, US payroll with tamper-evident tax forms, perpetual inventory,
bank feeds, analytics — with every record in local files you control. No
cloud, no account, no telemetry, no caps, no paid tiers. **Multi-user
Server Edition is built into the same signed installer — no Docker
required** (Docker remains an optional path for Linux servers).

**Get started:**

*One free product, two shapes: your desktop — or the whole office from one PC.*

## The Story

I ran QuickBooks 2003 Pro for 14 years for side-business invoicing and
bookkeeping. Then the hard drive died. Intuit's activation servers have
been dead since ~2017, so the software can't be reinstalled. The license
I paid for is worthless.

So I built my own replacement, and transferred my data out of the old
.QBW file using IIF export/import. Early versions wore the grief openly —
the code was annotated with invented "decompilation" comments referencing
`QBW32.EXE` offsets and Btrieve table layouts as a tribute to software
that served me well until its maker decided it should stop working. The
codebase has since grown up and the fiction now lives only in this
origin story; the software never depended on it.

**This is an independent, from-scratch reimplementation.** No Intuit
source code or binaries were available, decompiled, or used.

## What's New

**v2.7 — Jobs, job costing, and receipt intake.** QuickBooks-style
Customer:Job on every form and every posted line, nested cost codes with
cost types and burden, Job Cost Entries for labor / equipment / mileage /
overhead, time posted to jobs at loaded rates, budgets seeded from
estimates, and a job page that drills from cost type to code to the
posted line with Budget / Committed / Actual / Projected / Variance — the
columns contractors already read. QuickBooks `Customer:Job` and Online
sub-customers import as jobs. Plus **receipt intake**: scan a receipt
photo or PDF into a Bill, Expense or Sales Receipt with a box-to-fix
canvas, using the OCR engine built into macOS and Windows (Tesseract on
Linux). Design notes: [docs/design/projects.md](docs/design/projects.md).

**v2.6 — Sales receipts.** Point-of-sale style sales on one screen: the
sale and its payment recorded together, deposited where you say, posted
atomically — and kept on their own page so they don't clutter your
invoices. Your existing receipt history imports too: `CASH SALE` blocks
from QuickBooks Desktop IIF files and the SalesReceipt entity over the
QuickBooks Online connection, with a migration guide covering both paths
([docs/migrate-from-quickbooks.md](docs/migrate-from-quickbooks.md)).
Built because a user asked for it.

**v2.5 — Server Edition.** The same signed installer can serve your whole
office from one Windows PC: users with roles (admin / bookkeeper /
read-only), username logins, per-user audit attribution, and a startup
task that has the books serving before anyone logs in — everyone else
just needs a browser. An edition is a state, not a SKU: add a second user
and you've promoted yourself, free either way. Field-verified on real
office hardware before release. See
**[docs/server-edition.md](docs/server-edition.md)**.

v2.5 also debuts the **signed & notarized Apple Silicon macOS app**
(maintained by [@ContractorKeith](https://github.com/ContractorKeith)) —
a native `.app` in a DMG, no Docker or Python required.

![Server Edition: LAN-served dashboard and user management](screenshots/server-edition-grid.png)

**v2.4 — Bank feeds & the AI-ready API.** Automatic transaction sync via
[SimpleFIN](https://www.simplefin.org/) — you hold the bank credential,
no middleman server, dedup + bank rules on arrival
([docs/setup-bank-feeds.md](docs/setup-bank-feeds.md)). Every install
also serves a self-documenting 357-operation local REST API; point
Claude Code or any agentic CLI at it —
[slowbookspro.com/ai](https://www.slowbookspro.com/ai/) has the
paste-prompt.

**v2.3 — Migrate from anywhere.** One Migrate Data page for Xero, MYOB,
Sage 50, Wave, Zoho Books, and GnuCash — every import dry-run-verified
against your trial balance before a single record is written, with
opening balances posted automatically.

Full history in **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**.

## Wait — it does *that*?

**Cryptographically tamper-evident tax forms.** Every W-2, W-3, 940, and
941 PDF carries a SHA-256 content hash and audit ID printed in the
footer. An auditor can recompute the hash and confirm the form hasn't
been edited since generation, against the local `document_audits` chain.
Not a watermark — a verification trail.

**Bring-your-own-AI, including your own gateway.** AI Insights runs
against any of seven providers (xAI Grok, Groq, Cloudflare Workers AI,
Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini, or a Cloudflare Worker you host
yourself) — keys encrypted at rest with versioned, rotatable ciphertext.
And the whole app is agent-operable through its local API: see the
[AI setup guide](https://www.slowbookspro.com/ai/).

**One-click reseller-permit verification.** Per-state format validation
(WA/CA/TX), one click opens the state's official lookup, and the
who-and-when verification trail lands on the customer record.

**Boots refuse to lie to you.** Dev and debug containers run the
frontend↔backend wiring audit *before* uvicorn binds the port — drift
between the JS and the routes fails the boot instead of 404-ing
mid-feature. Release images gate on the same check in CI.

## Quick Start

### Windows — signed installer

Download **[SlowBooksPro-Setup-x64.exe](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026/releases/latest/download/SlowBooksPro-Setup-x64.exe)**
and double-click. Fully self-contained (64-bit Windows 10/11); portable
.zip on the [releases page](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026/releases/latest).
Each company is one SQLite file under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SlowBooksPro` —
upgrades and even uninstalls never touch your books.

**Serve the office (Server Edition):** on the host PC, run the bundled
`serveredition-install.ps1` from an elevated PowerShell — firewall,
startup task, and machine-wide data location handled. Details in
[docs/server-edition.md](docs/server-edition.md).

### macOS — signed Apple Silicon app

Download **[SlowBooksPro-macos-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026/releases/latest/download/SlowBooksPro-macos-arm64.dmg)**,
drag **SlowBooks Pro** to Applications, launch. Signed and notarized;
macOS 14+. Intel Macs: use Docker until a tested Intel build ships.

### Docker (Linux servers, Intel Mac)

Docker is optional — multi-user LAN serving on Windows is **Server
Edition**, built into the signed installer above (no containers involved).
Docker remains the path for Linux servers and Intel Macs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026.git
cd SlowBooks-Pro-2026
docker compose up
```

Open **http://localhost:3001** — PostgreSQL, migrations, and seed data
are automatic. The image includes `tesseract-ocr` and `poppler-utils` so
receipt scanning works out of the box; native installs add them with
`sudo apt install tesseract-ocr poppler-utils` (optional — scanning
degrades gracefully when they're absent).

Native installs, demo data, troubleshooting: **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.
Backups, restore, key rotation: **[docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md)**.
Production checklist: **[docs/release-checklist.md](docs/release-checklist.md)**.

## Tech Stack

Python + FastAPI on PostgreSQL (SQLite for tests and desktop companies,
one file each) with SQLAlchemy 2.0 and Alembic. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
single-page app — no framework, no build step. WeasyPrint + Jinja2 for
PDFs; self-hosted Chart.js (no CDN, LAN-deployable). Hosted-checkout
payments only — card data never touches the app. Port 3001.

The Windows and Apple Silicon desktop builds freeze the same codebase
with PyInstaller + pywebview. Both sign in CI on every release tag:
Windows via Azure Trusted Signing, macOS with the project's Apple
Developer ID — signed, notarized, and stapled on the runner (signing
credentials live only in repo secrets, never in the repo).

Full layout in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).
